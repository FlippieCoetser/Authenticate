\title{Encryption Processor Constructor}
\usage{
Encryption.Processor(service)
}
\arguments{
\item{service}{An encryption service object that provides cryptographic functions,
such as password hashing. This service should include a \code{Hash.Password} function
that accepts a password and salt, returning a hashed password.}
}
\value{
A list of functions that perform operations on model data, specifically:
\describe{
\item{\code{Set.Hash}}{
Updates a model object with a hashed password. The model must have a 'hash'
field and a 'salt' field. The password is hashed using the provided salt
and the hash function from the encryption service.
\itemize{
\item \code{model}: The model object containing the user data.
\item \code{password}: The plain text password to be hashed.
}
Returns the modified model object with the hashed password.
}
}
}
\description{
Creates a processor that utilizes an encryption service to handle password hashing
operations within a model object. This processor relies on an external encryption
service, passed as a parameter, to hash passwords using the service's specific
cryptographic methods.
}
